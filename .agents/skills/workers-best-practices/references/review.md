# Code Review — Workers

How to review Workers code for type correctness, API usage, config validity, and best practices. This is self-contained — do not assume access to other skills.

## Retrieval

Prefer retrieval over pre-training. Types, config schemas, and APIs change with compatibility dates and new bindings.

### Workers types

Use the installed version for reproducible validation; consult latest types/docs when investigating API drift. This repo uses JavaScript, so generated Env/type checking is optional unless the task introduces it.

Inspect `deploy/matses-voice/worker/node_modules/@cloudflare/workers-types`
if installed; otherwise retrieve official types into an explicitly allowed
scratch directory. Pin the inspected version and exact archive filename rather
than extracting a wildcard into a shared temporary directory.

Search the retrieved type file for the specific type, class, or interface under review. Do not guess type names.

Alternative: `npx wrangler types` generates a typed `Env` interface from the local wrangler config.

Fallback: read `node_modules/@cloudflare/workers-types/index.d.ts`. Note the installed version.

### Wrangler config schema

The authoritative schema is bundled with wrangler as `config-schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07).

```bash
# Read from local node_modules
cat node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
```

Do not guess field names or structures — look them up.

### Cloudflare docs

Use the Cloudflare docs search tool if available, or fetch from `https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/`. The best practices page lives at `/workers/best-practices/workers-best-practices/`.

## Type Validation

### Env interface

- Every binding must have a specific type. Flag `any`, `unknown`, `object`, or `Record<string, unknown>` on bindings.
- Binding types that accept generic parameters (Durable Object namespaces, Queues, Service bindings for RPC) must include them. Read the type definition to confirm which types are generic.
- Binding names must match the wrangler config exactly.
- Prefer generated types from `wrangler types` over hand-written interfaces.

### Handler and class signatures

Verify against current type definitions — do not assume signatures are stable.

- Correct import path (most Workers platform classes import from `"cloudflare:workers"`)
- Generic type parameter on base classes (e.g., `DurableObject<Env>`)
- Binding access pattern: `env.X` in module export handlers, `this.env.X` in classes extending platform base classes
- `ExecutionContext` as the third param in module export handlers (needed for `ctx.waitUntil()`)
- `fetch()` handlers must return `Promise<Response>`

### Binding access — the most common error

- **Module export handlers** (`fetch`, `scheduled`, `queue`, `email`): bindings via `env.X` parameter
- **Platform base classes** (`WorkerEntrypoint`, `DurableObject`, `Workflow`, `Agent`): bindings via `this.env.X`

Flag `env.X` inside a class extending a platform base class. Flag `this.env.X` inside a module export handler.

### Type integrity rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| No `any` | Never on binding types, handler params, or API responses |
| No double-casting | `as unknown as T` hides real incompatibilities — fix the underlying design |
| Justify suppressions | `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` must include a comment explaining why |
| Prefer `satisfies` | Use `satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>` over `as` — validates without widening |
| Validate, do not assert | Schema or type guard for untyped data (JSON, parsed bodies), not `as` |

### Stale class patterns

Old patterns survive in codebases long after APIs change.

- **`extends` vs `implements`**: platform classes use `extends`, not `implements`. The `implements` pattern is legacy and loses `this.ctx`, `this.env`.
- **Import paths**: verify module specifiers match what types actually export. Common mistake: wrong path for `"cloudflare:workers"` vs `"cloudflare:workflows"`.
- **Renamed properties**: e.g., `this.state` to `this.ctx` in Durable Objects. Search types to confirm.
- **Constructor signatures**: base class constructors change. Verify expected parameters.

## Config Validation

### Required fields

For executable examples, verify: `name`, `compatibility_date`, `main`. Check the schema for current required fields.

### Config format

- **JSONC** (`wrangler.jsonc`) — preferred for new projects
- **JSON** (`wrangler.json`) — valid but no comments
- **TOML** (`wrangler.toml`) — supported; this repo's deployment source of truth. Do not migrate merely for style

### Binding-code consistency

1. Every `env.X` reference in code has a corresponding binding declaration in config
2. Every binding in config is referenced in code (warn on unused)
3. Names match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. For Durable Objects: `class_name` matches the exported class name

### Common config mistakes

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Stale `compatibility_date` | Check required behavior and regression-test upgrades; age alone is not a defect |
| Missing DO migrations | Every new DO class needs a migration entry |
| Binding name mismatch | Config `binding`/`name` must match `env.X` in code |
| Secrets in config | Never in `vars` — use `wrangler secret put` |
| Wrong binding key | Verify top-level key name against the schema |
| Missing entrypoint | `main` required for executable Workers |

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

See the full anti-patterns table in `SKILL.md`. The type-specific ones to watch for during review:

- **`any` on `Env` or handler params** — defeats type safety for all downstream binding access
- **`as unknown as T`** — hides real type incompatibilities; fix the underlying design
- **`@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` without explanation** — masks errors silently; require a justifying comment
- **`implements` instead of `extends` on platform base classes** — legacy pattern; loses `this.ctx`, `this.env`
- **`env.X` inside class body** — should be `this.env.X` in platform base classes
- **`this.env.X` in module export handler** — should be `env.X` parameter
- **Non-serializable values across boundaries** — `Response`, `Error` in step/queue compiles but fails at runtime

---

## Serialization Boundaries

Validate each boundary's own serialization contract; JSON and structured clone are not interchangeable:

- **Queue messages**: body passed to `.send()` or `.sendBatch()`
- **Workflow step return values**: persisted to durable storage
- **DO storage**: values in `storage.put()` or SQL
- **`postMessage()`**: structured-clone contracts where supported; WebSocket `.send()` has its own string/binary contract

Prefer plain JSON-compatible records for durable messages and persisted step output. Functions, symbols and request/response objects generally cannot cross these boundaries. Map/Set/Date/ArrayBuffer and Error support differs by API: check documentation rather than banning all structured-clone types. D1 bindings accept SQL values, not arbitrary objects.

## Review Process

1. **Retrieve** — fetch latest workers types, wrangler schema, and best practices page
2. **Read full files** — not just diffs; context matters for binding access patterns
3. **Categorize code** — determines what to check:
   - **Illustrative** (concept demo, comments for most logic): verify correct API names and realistic signatures
   - **Demonstrative** (functional snippet, would work in context): verify syntax, correct APIs, correct binding access
   - **Executable** (standalone, runs without modification): verify compiles, runs, includes imports and config
4. **Check types** — binding access pattern, handler signatures, no `any`, no unsafe casts
5. **Check config** — compatibility_date, nodejs_compat, observability, secrets, binding-code consistency
6. **Check patterns** — streaming, floating promises, global state, serialization boundaries
7. **Check security** — crypto usage, secret handling, timing-safe comparisons, error handling
8. **Validate with tools** — existing project checks; use `tsc --noEmit` only with a configured TS/check-JS project and type-aware promise lint only with the required setup
9. **Assess risk** — HIGH (auth, crypto, bindings), MEDIUM (business logic, config), LOW (style, comments)

### Output format

```
**[SEVERITY]** Brief description
`file.ts:42` — explanation with evidence
Suggested fix: `code`
```

Severity: **CRITICAL** (security, data loss, crash) | **HIGH** (type error, wrong API, broken config) | **MEDIUM** (missing validation, edge case) | **LOW** (style, minor improvement)
